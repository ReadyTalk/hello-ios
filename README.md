Avian on iOS example
====================

This is a simple example of how to use Avian on iOS.  These are the
steps required to build it:

__1.__ Get Avian:  

    $ git clone https://github.com/ReadyTalk/avian

__2.__ Get this example, if you don't already have it:  

    $ git clone https://github.com/ReadyTalk/hello-ios

__3.__ Build the example.  The default target is an iPhoneOS device,
which requires that XCode be configured with a valid iOS developer
certificate.  

    $ cd hello-ios && make

The codesign step may fail with the message "User interaction is not
allowed."  To fix this, you'll need to unlock your keychain and try
again:  

    $ security unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain

Alternatively, you can target the iPhoneSimulator instead, which
does not require code signing:  

    $ make sim=true

You can also run the result in the simulator:  
  
    $ make sim=true run
